# My Portfolio

> This portfolio is currently unfinished and will be updated as soon I have completed other projects.

## Summary

I wanted my portfolio to demonstrate a mix of my personality, style, and my previous projects. Using react and experimenting with new technologies and libraries. I am a creative person. Displaying this through the way I design websites is important to me. Taking websites to the next level by learning animation or 3d design with technologies like spline, framer and react-spring to use along side react on the front-end.

Unfortunatley, I don't have enough time to complete this now. I will be continuing my journey with these technologies and further practicing with building some passion projects.

## Design Idea

Having a doodle book design using my handwriting for titles, navbar and other text. Clean animation on homepage to give the user a feel of my style, followed with a description of my work and coding experience. Scrolling further down to see some animated statistics of my knowledge in different technologies. After, displaying a timeline of my experience in coding and previous experience.

Other pages would include:

- A 'Work' page to have 'tarot' styled cards that flip to display my previous work and projects.

- A 'Contact Me' that would include a contact form and a thankyou section with a downloadable CV button.
